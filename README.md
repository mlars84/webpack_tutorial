## Notes
- Webpack has quickly become one of the most popular choices among web developer build tools. It can quickly build, minify, split & do a whole wonder of other things to your code.

- In this webpack tutorial, I'm going to cover a very basic configuration for webpack that will get you started in a project. It will build all of your Javascript and minify and dedupe the code for production. To code react, we just have a little more configuration to add to our webpack config. That will have a full HTML, CSS, JS react application going.

- Another great build tool is Browserify, which at the beginning of the process works a LOT like Webpack, but in the end, Webpack is a lot more featureful.
